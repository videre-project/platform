# Cards API

For shared response, pagination, caching, and rate-limit behavior, see [API overview](index.md).

Videre's card API searches MTGO card catalog entries from the same PostgreSQL database that backs the event API. The card routes include deckbuilding metadata, search operators, token rows when requested, card-face data, legality data, and CDN image URLs. Sealed products and other non-card catalog objects are documented in the [Products API](products.md).

For the full `q` parameter grammar, including aliases, comparison operators, and unsupported Scryfall terms, see [Card search syntax](../reference/card-search.md).

The card routes are:

```text
GET /cards
QUERY /cards/search
POST /cards/search
GET /cards/named
GET /cards/autocomplete
GET /cards/random
GET /cards/:id
```

`/cards` returns a paginated list. `/cards/search` accepts the same filters with an optional request-local collection for personalized search. `/cards/named` returns one card by exact or fuzzy card name lookup. `/cards/autocomplete` returns matching card-name suggestions. `/cards/random` returns one random card from the same filtered search space as `/cards`. `/cards/:id` returns one searchable card object by MTGO catalog ID, including card faces when the object has multiple faces or subcard data.

## Query text

The `q` parameter accepts plain text plus tagged search terms. Untagged words search card names and oracle text. The dedicated syntax reference has the full operator list; this section shows the common forms used by the card routes.

```text
/cards?q=lightning bolt
/cards?q=set:MM2 name:"Lightning Bolt"
/cards?q=t:artifact -t:creature
```

Quoted values keep spaces together. Explicit query parameters and tagged `q` terms use the same underlying filters; explicit parameters win when both are supplied.

`q` supports comparison operators such as `mv<=2`, `pow>=4`, `r>=rare`, `c<=U`, and `released>=2024-01-01`. The explicit query parameters cover exact filters and list controls.

## Named lookup

`/cards/named` accepts exactly one of `exact` or `fuzzy`:

```text
/cards/named?exact=Lightning%20Bolt
/cards/named?fuzzy=lightnng%20bolt
```

`exact` uses exact normalized card-name matching across canonical names and printed titles. When the query matches a canonical name, ordinary printings rank ahead of printings with a different `printed_name`; when the query matches a printed title, that printed-title row is returned. `fuzzy` uses the same ranked card search as `/cards?q=...` and returns the top-ranked result. The response shape matches `/cards/:id`: a wrapper with a one-row `data` array.

`/cards/autocomplete` returns unique card-name suggestion strings in the standard list envelope:

```text
/cards/autocomplete?q=lightn
/cards/autocomplete?q=spirit&include_tokens=true&limit=20
```

Autocomplete searches canonical card names, printed card titles, canonical face names, and printed face titles. It excludes tokens by default unless `include_tokens=true` is supplied. `data` contains strings, not card objects.

Example autocomplete response, from `/cards/autocomplete?q=lightn&limit=5`:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "parameters": {
    "q": "lightn",
    "limit": 5
  },
  "meta": {
    "database": "api@worker-db.videreproject.com/mtgo",
    "backend": "postgres",
    "exec_ms": 123,
    "row_count": 5,
    "total": 5,
    "limit": 5,
    "offset": 0,
    "has_more": false,
    "next_offset": null
  },
  "data": [
    "Lightning Axe",
    "Lightning Blow",
    "Lightning Bolt",
    "Lightning Dart",
    "Lightning Mare"
  ]
}
```

## Random card

`/cards/random` accepts the same filters as `/cards` and returns one randomly selected matching card:

```text
/cards/random
/cards/random?q=t:dragon format:modern
/cards/random?set=SOS&unique=prints
```

The response shape matches `/cards/:id`: a wrapper with a one-row `data` array. This is still a cacheable `GET` route, so an identical random-card URL can return the same cached card until the public GET cache expires.

## Common filters

Name and text:

```text
/cards?name=Lightning
/cards?exact=Lightning Bolt
/cards?text=draw a card
/cards?q=artist:"Christopher Rush"
/cards?q=flavor:"when dragons"
```

Set and rarity:

```text
/cards?set=SOS
/cards?q=set:MM2 rarity:common
/cards?q=r>=rare
/cards?q=year:2021
/cards?q=released>=2024-01-01
```

Rarity comparisons use the normal rarity ladder: `common`, `uncommon`, `rare`, and `mythic`. MTGO-specific rarity values such as `token`, `bonus`, and `promo` are exact rarity filters rather than ordered rarity values.

Colors and color identity:

```text
/cards?q=c<=U
/cards?q=c:%3EWU
/cards?q=id:%3DRG
```

Color operators follow Scryfall-style set logic:

| Operator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `=` | Exactly these colors. |
| `<=` | At most these colors. |
| `>=` | At least these colors. |

MTGO colorless values are exposed as `C` in the API response, so a query like `colors<=U` can return cards whose `colors` array is `["C"]`.

Type filters can be combined with commas or repeated tagged terms in `q`:

```text
/cards?type=artifact,!creature
/cards?q=t:adventure
/cards?q=t:instant -t:sorcery
```

Numeric filters support mana value, power, toughness, loyalty, and defense:

```text
/cards?mana_value=1
/cards?q=mv<=1 -t:land
/cards?q=pow>=4 tou<4
```

Mana-cost filters match exact printed costs:

```text
/cards?mana_cost={R}
/cards?q=m:{U}{U}
```

Catalog filters cover MTGO-specific identifiers:

```text
/cards?q=number:150 set:MM2
/cards?q=artid:147
```

## Formats and legalities

Format filters use MTGO format codes. If a format filter omits the legality, the API treats it as `legal`.

```text
/cards?format=modern
/cards?q=format:pioneer
/cards?q=legal:modern
/cards?q=legality:modern:banned
```

The response includes a `legalities` object keyed by format code.

## Tokens, products, and uniqueness

Tokens are cards in the MTGO catalog. Default card searches return non-token cards; `include_tokens=true` includes token rows alongside non-token cards, and token-only filters return token rows without non-token cards.

```text
/cards?q=is:token
/cards?is_token=true
/cards?q=spirit&include_tokens=true
/cards?q=is:promo
/cards?q=is:multiface
/cards?q=is:split
```

Sealed products and other non-card MTGO catalog objects are returned by `/products`.
For collection splitting, `QUERY /cards/search?q=is:product` returns matching rows from the product catalog rather than the card catalog. POST supports the same request for compatibility, which allows a collection payload to mix card and product MTGO catalog IDs. Use `/products` for general product queries.

The `unique` option controls print collapsing:

```text
/cards?q=Lightning Bolt&unique=cards
/cards?q=Lightning Bolt&unique=prints
```

`cards` returns one representative per oracle card. `prints` returns each MTGO printing.

MTGO foil clones are preserved in the database as catalog variants rather than independent card rows. Those variants usually lack separate `/cards` results, and ordinary foil clone catalog IDs therefore lack separate CDN images.

## Collection-aware search

`QUERY /cards/search` personalizes card search against a caller-provided MTGO collection. Its query string accepts the filters, sorting, and pagination controls supported by `GET /cards`, while the JSON body adds a `collection` object. `POST /cards/search` accepts the same request for compatibility; clients that support QUERY should use it so equivalent requests can share the Worker cache.

```http
QUERY /cards/search?q=lightning%20bolt&unique=prints
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "collection": {
    "ids": [605, 1195],
    "mode": "rank",
    "match": "prints"
  }
}
```

`collection.ids` must contain positive integer MTGO catalog IDs. The inline pool is capped at 10,000 IDs, and duplicate IDs are ignored.

Collection modes:

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `only` | Return matching cards from the collection only. |
| `exclude` | Return matching cards outside the collection only. |
| `rank` | Return all matching cards, ranking collection matches first. |

Collection matching:

| Match | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `prints` | Match exact MTGO catalog IDs. |
| `oracle` | Treat owned print IDs as ownership of every card with the same oracle ID. |

When omitted, `mode` defaults to `only` and `match` defaults to `prints`.

Collection-backed responses include `in_collection` on each returned card and summarize the collection in `parameters.collection` by mode, match, and size, without echoing the full ID list. Successful QUERY and POST responses use the public card-search cache policy:

```text
Cache-Control: max-age=3600, s-maxage=1800
```

The Worker derives one cache key for equivalent QUERY and POST requests from the route, query parameters, content type, API cache version, and normalized request body. The URL contains only a hash of those inputs, while numeric ID arrays are deduplicated and sorted before hashing so equivalent collections reuse the same entry.

Both methods use the collection-aware card-search rate limit. See [Rate limits](../reference/rate-limits.md) for the current threshold.

Example collection-backed requests:

```text
QUERY /cards/search?q=type:creature&unique=cards
QUERY /cards/search?exact=Lightning%20Bolt&unique=prints
QUERY /cards/search?q=dragon&order=rank
QUERY /cards/search?q=is:product
```

When `q=is:product` or `is_product=true` is supplied to QUERY or POST `/cards/search`, collection matching is exact by MTGO catalog ID. Product rows use the Products API response shape plus `in_collection` when a collection is provided. Product catalog IDs are not oracle-grouped, so `collection.match=oracle` has no additional effect for product results.

## Response shape

Card result objects include the MTGO catalog fields used for deckbuilding and search:

```text
id
oracle_id
set_code
set_name
set_release_date
set_type
collector_number
name
canonical_name
printed_name
display_name
artist
art_id
mana_cost
mana_value
type_line
oracle_text
flavor_text
colors
color_identity
power
toughness
loyalty
defense
rarity
frame_style
promo_label
is_token
is_promo
is_multiface
is_split
legalities
image_url
in_collection
```

The `name` field is the canonical mechanical card name used by existing clients; `canonical_name` is the same value under an explicit field name. `printed_name` is `null` unless the MTGO catalog row has a different printed title, such as Universes Within-style promotional treatments. `display_name` is `printed_name` when present and otherwise the canonical name. `oracle_text` is imported from the MTGO catalog row and can contain the printed title on rows where `printed_name` is set.

`in_collection` is present only on QUERY or POST `/cards/search` responses that include a collection.

Catalog flags such as `is_token`, `is_promo`, `is_multiface`, and `is_split` reflect imported MTGO catalog fields. Some flag values can be `null` when the source catalog row lacks that value.

`/cards/:id` also includes ordered `faces` for split, modal, adventure, and other multi-face catalog entries.

      },
      "image_url": "https://r2.videreproject.com/cards/605-300px.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

Abbreviated printed-title card object:

```json
{
  "id": 139943,
  "set_code": "FCA",
  "name": "Lightning Bolt",
  "canonical_name": "Lightning Bolt",
  "printed_name": "Thrum of the Vestige",
  "display_name": "Thrum of the Vestige",
  "promo_label": "FFXIII",
  "oracle_text": "Thrum of the Vestige deals 3 damage to any target.",
  "image_url": "https://r2.videreproject.com/cards/139943-300px.png"
}
```

## Sorting and pagination

```text
/cards?q=dragon&order=name&dir=asc&limit=25&offset=50
/cards?q=dragon&order=name&include_total=true
```

Supported sort keys are `rank`, `name`, `mana_value`, `set`, and `released`. Card search fetches one extra row by default, so `has_more` and `next_offset` are available without running a second exact-count query. `total` is `null` unless `include_total=true` is supplied or `limit=500` is requested. In those cases, the API runs an exact count query and returns the count in `meta.total`.
