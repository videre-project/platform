# Events API

For shared response, pagination, caching, and rate-limit behavior, see [API Overview](index.md).

The events API lists imported MTGO event records. Each row identifies the event by ID, name, date, format, kind, round count, and player count.

```text
GET /events/:format?
```

The endpoint is the event index for tournament-backed data. Each returned `id` is accepted as `event_id` on `/decks`, `/matches`, `/standings`, `/metagame`, `/archetypes`, and `/matchups`, so those routes can be scoped to the same imported event.

## Filters

```text
/events/modern
/events?format=pioneer&limit=25
/events/modern?min_date=2026-06-01&max_date=2026-06-26
/events/modern?kind=Challenge&limit=25
/events?event_id=12845711
```

Supported query parameters are `format`, `kind`, `event_id`, `min_date`, `max_date`, `limit`, and `offset`.

`format` can be supplied as the path segment or as a query parameter. If both are present, the path value wins because it is parsed as the route parameter.

`event_id` selects one imported event and takes precedence over date filters.

`kind` filters by the MTGO event family, such as `League`, `Preliminary`, `Challenge`, `Showcase`, or `Qualifier`. It is applied before pagination.

`min_date` and `max_date` use calendar dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` form. If no `event_id` or date range is supplied, the API uses the default recent event window described in [API Overview](index.md).

`limit` controls how many event rows are returned after sorting by newest event first. `offset` and `limit` page through event history.

Responses use the standard list envelope with `meta.limit`, `meta.offset`, `meta.has_more`, and `meta.next_offset`.

## Response Shape

Each event includes:

```text
id
name
date
format
kind
rounds
players
```

`kind` is the MTGO event family, such as a League, Preliminary, Challenge, Showcase, or Qualifier. `rounds` and `players` are source event metadata.
